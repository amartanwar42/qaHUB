# What Problem it will solve:
As of now, we write blogs/articles on different available platforms and we create an open-source framework/project on GitHub or any other platform. Hence It becomes difficult for a QA to find out relevant content as it is distributed over the internet.
To solve this problem we have created qaHUB. Where we will have the best-curated content for each category. And it is going to be driven by us (QA). As we will share our learnings with others. 

# Functionality of qaHUB
* Users can see their submissions and it's status.
* Admin can create different categories.
* Admin can see all the list of pending submissions and after review, admin can publish it using just one click.
* Admin can see all the published submissions and can delete it at any time using just one click.
* Anyone can share their learnings using ShareKnowledge.
* Each category is further divided into subcategories like Blog/Article, Projects, Podcast/Videos, Presentation/Slides.
* Web responsive view

# Who can Contribute:
